## Project Overview

The Growtopia Data Extraction Project is a C++ tool that:

- Downloads the latest Growtopia.
- Extracts item data from the binary.
- Compares item names with those from a previous version.
- Outputs new or updated items.

## Building the Project

To build the project, you'll need `g++` and `libcurl` installed. Hereâ€™s how you can compile the code:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

2. **Compile the Project:**
   - Run the following command to compile the source code and link against `libcurl`:
     ```sh
     g++ src/dataminer.cpp -I"C:\libcurl\include" -L"C:\libcurl\lib" -lcurl
     ```
   - Adjust the `-I` and `-L` paths as necessary to point to your `libcurl` installation directories.

3. **Verify the Build:**
   - Ensure that the executable `dataminer.exe` is created in the project directory.

## Using the Tool

1. **Run the Tool:**
   - Open a Command Prompt in the project directory.
   - Execute the compiled binary:
     ```sh
     dataminer.exe
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to input the previous version number.

2. **Review Results:**
   - The tool will download the latest Growtopia version, extract the relevant data, compare items with the previous version, and display new or updated items.

## Releases

For users who prefer not to compile the code, precompiled version is available. You can download it from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Bolwl/Dataminer/releases).
